# AndroidTintRemover

Forked from OreoTintRemover.

Gives you a crystal clear lockscreen. Notification shade is also made crystal clear

Tested to work on my device, Redmi Note 7 Pro running Lineage 16.0 (Android 9.0)

This Xposed module will likely work for any other ROM based on AOSP, however I make no guarantees and offer no warranty or support.

1. Install latest Magisk Framework (tested with Magisk 19.3)
2. Install "Riru - Core" Magisk module (tested with version 19.5)
3. Optionally reboot here
4. Install "Riru - EdXposed" Magisk module (tested with v0.4.5.1_beta(4463) Sandhook)
5. Install [EdXposed Manager](https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposedManager/releases/tag/v4.5.1), tested to work with version 4.5.1
6. Build this module, and install it (release coming soon)
4. Enable the module in Xposed Installer
5. Reboot
